FloralAura is a beautifully designed online flower shop website built using HTML and CSS.
The project aims to bring the joy of gifting flowers into a digital experience through a clean, modern, and responsive design. It allows users to browse through a wide variety of stunning floral arrangements, learn more about the brandâ€™s story, and easily get in touch through the contact form. Every part of the website is carefully structured to create a warm and welcoming experience, reflecting the essence of freshness and care that flowers represent.

The website includes several well-organized sections such as the navigation bar, hero section, product showcase, about page, and a contact section. The hero section offers an inviting introduction to the shop with a call-to-action button, while the product area displays different bouquets perfect for every occasion from birthdays and anniversaries to weddings and simple gestures of appreciation. The about section tells the story of FloralAura, sharing its passion for spreading happiness through flowers, and the contact section makes it easy for users to reach out for inquiries or orders.

Designed with simplicity and elegance in mind, the project uses soft pastel color palettes, smooth hover effects, and a grid-based responsive layout to ensure that it looks great on all devices  from desktops to mobile screens. The sticky navigation bar improves usability, and subtle animations make the browsing experience more engaging without overwhelming the viewer.

This project is ideal for beginners looking to learn how to design aesthetic, user-friendly web pages using just HTML and CSS. It demonstrates how good layout, typography, and color coordination can come together to build a professional-looking website even without JavaScript or backend systems.
